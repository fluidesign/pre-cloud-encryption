# == Encryption/Decryption script for GoodSync

# == Requirements
# ================================================================================
# Requirements:
#   GoodSync (Windows version)
#   AxCrypt (Windows version)

#=================================================================================
# == Description
# ================================================================================
# This is a script to be used by GoodSync in order to keep a remote encrypted repository of 
# ALL the files in a local directory. The synchronization is kept between
# the local files (not encrypted) and the remote copies (encrypted).
# The concept is easy but can be tricky:
# - The user synchronizes his local files with a remote repository (e.g. a cloud server, network drive)
# - The files in the remote repo will be only encrypted files, so we can use a third party provider
#   and forget about any concerns on privacy.
# - If another user wants to use the same files from that repo, the system will keep in sync even
#   with the encrypted files in the remote repo.
# - The remote repo can serve, therefore, as a backup or middle repository, ALWAYS KEEPING PRIVACY.
# - If different users want to use the same repository, they will have to use the same encrypting key.
#
# Typical use case:
# 1.The user creates a job to be synced with a cloud repository (or another folder, whatever).
# 2.Everytime the job is run, all the files on that folder are automatically encrypted and the 
#   originals are deleted temporarily, leaving the encrypted versions only in the local directory.
# 3.The analysis and comparison of versions is done among only the encrypted files in both sides(L #   and R).
# 4a.If changes are detected, the corresponding files will be synced (either uploaded or downloaded)  
# 4b.If no changes are detected, nothing happens.
# 5.Finally, the local files are decrypted back in the local directory, leaving only plain
#   unencrypted files there (no encrypted files will remain at this point).
#
# Note: We decided to encrypt every single file every time the job is called.
# If we only encrypted the recently changed files the files that are not encrypted in 
# this step remain unencrypted in the directory and are synced via GoodSync as plain format,
# something we don't want. For sure there are more elegant ways to approach that but they are
# out of scope.

# == Usage of the script
# ================================================================================

# ====================
# Usage in GoodSync 
# ====================
# Usage in GoodSync:
# Note: The usage must be coherent in all the command lines. That is to say, the passphrase,
# directory and recursion parameter (-m) must equal for Pre-Analysis, Post-Analysis and Post-Sync.
# Therefore, within the Automation section of a job, add the following commands.
#
# Pre Analysis:
# [Route_to_script\]GoodSync-Encrypt-Decrypt.py PA "[my_passphrase]" "[my_directory]" [-m]
# Post Analysis with no changes:
# [Route_to_script\]GoodSync-Encrypt-Decrypt.py PS "[my_passphrase]" "[my_directory]" [-m]
# Post Sync:
# [Route_to_script\]GoodSync-Encrypt-Decrypt.py PS "[my_passphrase]" "[my_directory]" [-m]
# 
# =====================
# Usage in command line 
# =====================
# Usage in command line:
# GoodSync-Encrypt-Decrypt.py <phase> <pass> <dir> <recursive>
#   <phase> (%1) is the GoodSync phase. Either PA (PreAnalysis, for encryption) or PS (PostSync, for
#                decryption)
#   <pass> (%2) is the encryption passphrase
#   <dir> (%3) is the root folder where the encryption has to start. Do not add trailing slash!
#   <recursive> (%4) can be -m or empty. If -m , then the encryption applies to all the subdirectories
	# Put it on the same directory as the script and the input file. 
	

# ====================
# Examples
# ====================
#   GoodSync-Encrypt-Decrypt.py PA test "test axcrypt" -m
#   GoodSync-Encrypt-Decrypt.py PS test "test axcrypt" -m 
#   GoodSync-Encrypt-Decrypt.py PA test "test axcrypt"
#   GoodSync-Encrypt-Decrypt.py PA "test password with blank spaces" "test axcrypt"
#   GoodSync-Encrypt-Decrypt.py PA "passwordNoSpacesAndInsideQuotes" "test axcrypt"
#   GoodSync-Encrypt-Decrypt.py PA "test" "C:\Users\raul cano\Documents\temp\test axcrypt" -m
